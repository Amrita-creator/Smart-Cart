# SmartCart – Customer Segmentation using Clustering

## Overview
SmartCart is a machine learning project based on **unsupervised learning** that segments customers based on their **income and spending behavior**.

The project classifies customers into **four categories**, such as:
- High Income – High Spending
- High Income – Low Spending
- Low Income – High Spending
- Low Income – Low Spending

This helps businesses understand customer behavior and discover hidden patterns in the dataset.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and analysis
- Customer segmentation using clustering
- Visualization of clusters
- Cluster summary and characteristics
- Comparison of clustering techniques

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## Machine Learning Techniques Used
- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Agglomerative Clustering (Hierarchical Clustering)**

Both techniques were used to group customers and analyze patterns in the data.

---

## How It Works
1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
3. Apply **K-Means** clustering.
4. Apply **Agglomerative (Hierarchical)** clustering.
5. Visualize clusters and interpret results.
6. Generate cluster summaries and characteristics.

---

## Results
The model successfully grouped customers into **four distinct clusters**, helping identify spending patterns and customer segments.

---

## Future Improvements
- Try other clustering methods like DBSCAN
- Build a dashboard for visualization
- Deploy the project as a web application
